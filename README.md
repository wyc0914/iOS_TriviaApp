# Project 4 - *Trivia App*

Submitted by: **Yicheng Wang**

**Trivia App** is an app that presents users with a question on the screen and offers either a set of four answer choices or a true/false selection. The app displays the next question once the user selects an answer to the current one. The app will pose five questions to the user, and after the user has answered all five questions, a popup alert will appear showing the user's score and offering a button to restart the app.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Notes

A challenge that I encounter when building this app was that at the beginning when working with true/false questions the app would still presents four answer choices and I have no idea on how to make the app only presents two selections when a true/false question comes up. Thus, I search online and found ways to hide the two extra buttons when a true/false question comes up.
